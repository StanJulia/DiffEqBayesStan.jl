# Inference for Stan model: pes4_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(0,0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1,1); 4000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (7.5, 6.9, 6.9, 6.0) seconds, 27 seconds total
# Sampling took (6.6, 6.2, 5.7, 6.9) seconds, 25 seconds total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
